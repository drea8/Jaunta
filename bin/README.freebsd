FreeBSD users: You can use the binary releases by running:

  ./derasterize.com -h

Assuming your login shell is bash. Otherwise you may need to run:

  /bin/sh ./derasterize.com -h

Just once, and it'll patch itself. This is needed due to restrictions
that the FreeBSD introduced in their forked version of the Almquist
Shell, which break compatibility with Sixth Edition shell scripts.
